# IsMoMe-Berufstest

## What's the project about?
This was a project for my course "Object Oriented Programming II" in the 2nd semester. 

## Motivation
A study shows that a lot of students are not well informed about the new jobs. The digitalization offers a lot of new jobs, but students often do not know about them. We want to offer an interesting way to find those jobs. Our project also finds a job that fits to the persons skills and interests. 

## Initial project description
We want to try to provide information about new jobs in a playful way. For this purpose, the user is asked questions, depending on the answer, the professions are filtered from the database and after each question a job is presented to the user. 

## Which programming languages & technologies were used?
The project was programmed with Java in Eclipse. The GUI-Toolkit Swing was used.

## Who worked on the projekt?
This was a teamwork with Isabella Freese and Melody Fuhrmann
